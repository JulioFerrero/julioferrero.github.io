This is my little piece of the internet where I publish information about my projects, tutorials and crash the server doing tests.
At the moment I do not have a clear path, maybe tomorrow I deleted this page and I have done something new, or the other way around, maybe I have taken it more seriously and am publishing posts or improving the style of the web.
For this reason, take it easy, enjoy the moment, you can explore this site and take whatever you want, you can send me an email or contact me through telegram, I have plenty of resources in this VPS, if someone wants I can give you an email account, a subdomain, an sftp account, a web in ipfs with ipns, etc.
If there is something new you can see the blog section or maybe update in index, it depends on what comes to mind.

Greetings,
LostCat
